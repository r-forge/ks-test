This revision to ks.test() will complement an applied paper
(in submission to The American Statistician) and is part of the
subject of another paper (to the R Journal); once we're happy we 
may propose a change to R's stats::ks.test.

Please send questions or comments to Jay <john.emerson@yale.edu>
and Taylor <taylor.arnold@yale.edu>
