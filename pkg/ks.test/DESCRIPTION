Title: Proposed Revision to stats::ks.test()
Author: Taylor B. Arnold and John W. Emerson
Maintainer: Taylor B. Arnold <taylor.arnold@yale.edu>
Description: This package simply contains a proposed new ks.test() function
  and the associated ks.test.Rd help page.  With one minor exception, it
  does not change the existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features
  necessary for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete
  distributions.
