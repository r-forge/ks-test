Title: Discrete Goodness-of-Fit Tests
Author: Taylor B. Arnold and John W. Emerson
Maintainer: Taylor B. Arnold <taylor.arnold@yale.edu>
Description: This package contains a proposed revision to the stats::ks.test()
  function and the associated ks.test.Rd help page.  With one minor exception,
  it does not change the existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features
  necessary for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete
  distributions.  The package also contains cvm.test(), for doing one-sample
  Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
